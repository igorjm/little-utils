An opinionated easy to use javascript utils lib

### Motivation
Much of what we're developing here is easy to develope in your current project. Our goal is to create an easy-to-use lib to avoid code duplication and rewrite of utils across your different projects

A project must have some interesting parts to works properly:
- clean code
- unit tests
- light and fast build
- continuous integration

All of those parts requires time and persistence from developers to learn how to search/validates/tests/implement. This is the type of learning that motivates us to create this library.

### Usage
With npm: `npm i @onluiz/penknife`

### Docs
Soon =)

### Credits
- To [redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) repository: this project architecture is based on Redux's. This decision was made based on redux architecture maturity
